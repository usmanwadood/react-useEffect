# useState and useEffect React Hooks

Using hooks in React makes all the difference in web qpplications. Not only do they make your code concise, but they provide so much power to the developer
I have made a filter using both the hooks, where clicking on any of the three buttons outputs its respective JSON object from jsonplaceholder website!
We can use this functionality in our own website to filter out data and output it to the client/ customer
In what functionality? well..... (drumrolls) 
  e commerce shopping carts or product pages where the customer wants a particular product and searches for it!
